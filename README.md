KSP 1&2 Mixed Soundtrack
Keep the original soundtrack of KSP 1 while adding the most fitting tracks from KSP 2.

You can't do without KSP's stock music, but you feel that certain scenes deserve additional background music? You try custom playlists and think “Meh, this doesn't feel like KSP”
Then this mod is made for you! 
It keeps KSP's original music but also adds most of the music from KSP 2 which fits well with KSP 1. Many scenes and planets will now have their own specific music depending on the context, but always in a subtle way, while keeping the original music.   

Bonus: This mode is for stock KSP but provides compatibility with JNSQ, including custom playlist for Nara !

Installation :
1.	First, install Soundtrack Editor Forked and it's dependencies
2.	Secondly, extract the entire contents of ‘KSP1&2_Mixed_Soundtrack’ to the root KSP folder (not gamedata !), merging the folders with the existing KSP folders. It should look like …/Kerbal Space Program/Music and .../ Kerbal Space Program/Playlists or something similar

3.	Have fun!

- Take-Two Interactive for the KSP 2 music (and for not shutting down this post), they're all Take-Two Interactive's property
